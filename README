You know, I looked around the Net back in 1994 and I was really surprised
that I couldn't find a sensible "replace" command (not true any more - the
"rpl" command has come on the scene to rival this program, but I hope you'll
use this one instead !).

This was probably because most UNIX hackers say "we've got sed, what do we need
a replace command for ?". Well, my reply is that the sed syntax is disgraceful
and totally user-hostile. It's also quite likely to come up with
"sed: command garbled" and fail to send ANYTHING to stdout, meaning you
end up wrecking your file if you try to call sed via a small shell script
interface.

So I cooked up this "replace" command - it's been pretty straightforward to
write, although if you check out the FEATURES file, you'll see it now has many
additional features that sed doesn't.

NOTE: I cannot be sure that "replace" is totally bug-free. I accept no
      responsibility for the possible irreversible overwriting of files
      (especially with "replace -f") - I would recommend you try it on
      a copy of a few of your important files before you dare to use
      "replace -f".

Anyway, I'll leave you to read the man page and enjoy.
